### Design: 

* Color Scheme: 
    * The three main colors used are Black, Pink & Beige.

* Typography:
    * All Headers use Karla. Karla is a sans-serif font with nice letter-spacing - which makes it easy-to-read & clean.
    * Montserrat is my secondary font, used for paragraphs. Like Karla, it is both clean & easy to read especially on smaller devices & pairs nicely with Karla. 
    * Sans-Serif is used as the backup font for both Karla & Montserrat.

* Imagery: 
    * A bright, colorful image was used for the hero image to be eye-catching to the user. It also compliments the color scheme, adding an element of consistency to the website.

    * Network to assess whether it was picking up Javascript (status: 200) 

### 2. Testing User Stories (UX Section)

### A. First-Time Visitor Goals:

* As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and who the company is.
    * Upon entering the site, users are presented with a bright, catchy and easily readable banner image, which introduces the Company name and purpose of the site. Underneath, a introductory text follows with more context about occasions people can select from & CTA to click one of the selections below.
    * In the footer, a short about us blurb gives the user further details about the company.

* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find content most relevant to me.
    * The website is designed to be very clean and straight to the point. The goal being to allow users to find the spot that most fits their occasion, without being distracted by irrelevant content. 

* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to gather key information about each recommended location to be able to make an informed decision.
    * After selecting a marker on the map, users are presented with a very descriptive infoWindow, displaying information about the bar or restaurant, the address, and opening times. An image adds a nice visual of either the food or atmosphere of each spot.

* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to know where the restaurant/bar recommended to me is located.
    * Each recommended location populates the interactive Google Maps, allowing the user to see on the map where it is located.
    * When the user clicks on a marker, they can also see the address of the place on the infoWindow. 

* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to filter the information most interesting to me.
    * When a user clicks on a specific button, it will filter the map markers based on the occasion type. For example, if a user is looking for places to go to on their own - he/she clicks "Alone Again, Naturally" and is shown recommended locations perfect for going to alone.
    * If a user wants to see all locations again, they have the option to click "All Locations" and the map will be repopulated with all the markers.

* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to visit their social media pages to determine how big a following the company has & how trusted it is.
    * In the footer, social media icons lead to the company's social media pages, as well as Tripadvisor.

### B. Returning Visitor Goals

* As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to get a variety of options available for the occasion I select. 
    * Each occasion is linked to 5 different recommended locations. In total, the map is populated with 30 different spots, giving the user a lot of variety to choose from.

* As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in touch with the company with any questions or suggestions I may have.
    * In the footer, the user can find the email address of the company to get in touch with suggestions or questions.

### C. Frequent Visitor Goals 

* As a Frequent Visitor, I want to check to see if there are any newly added recommended locations that I can check out.
    * At this point the user is familiar with the layout of the website & can recognize new locations or occasions that have been added to the map.
