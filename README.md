### Design: 

* Color Scheme: 
    * The three main colors used are Black, Pink & Beige.

* Typography:
    * All Headers use Karla. Karla is a sans-serif font with nice letter-spacing - which makes it easy-to-read & clean.
    * Montserrat is my secondary font, used for paragraphs. Like Karla, it is both clean & easy to read especially on smaller devices & pairs nicely with Karla. 
    * Sans-Serif is used as the backup font for both Karla & Montserrat.

* Imagery: 
    * A bright, colorful image was used for the hero image to be eye-catching to the user. It also compliments the color scheme, adding an element of consistency to the website.
